This is my first git repository and my first proper delve into writing higher level code. 
Previously I did work as an electrician and a part of that was learning the basics of how assembly language worked. 
At a different time in my life, I did a basic course in python, but that was a long fucking time ago! 
Now it's time to start doing big boy code! 

Here's to the future!
