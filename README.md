This is my first git repository and my first proper delve into writing higher level code. 
Previously I did work as an electrician and a part of that was learning the basics of how assembly language worked. 
At a different time in my life, I did a basic course in python, but that was a long fucking time ago! 
Now it's time to start doing big boy code! 

Here's to the future!

    Very proud of the console calculator I made. It's number 13 in the bro code
    folder. The original tutorial for it was very simplistic, but I've gone way off
    the rails with it and added a ton of features:
     - Seperated the code into my own functions
     - added while loops for queries into whether or not the user input is
       invalid or correct
     - Checks for if the user attempts to divide by 0
     - Clearing error flags from the input stream upon errors
     - A loop function for the whole program that re-does the calculator
       until the user decides it time to close it
     - making the Y or N queries not case sensitive
